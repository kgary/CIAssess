Agile Teaching and Learning: Continuous Assessment
The GetProjectName.java is the landing page which displays the list of teams and invokes Index.jsp which in turn calls GetProjectInfo and GetCharts.java programs using an AJAX call and uses C3 js to render them onto the browser. The excel files to retrieve the git usernames for each student is also included. The daily scrumwise and weekly git json files currently reside on my local until they can be moved elsewhere.
